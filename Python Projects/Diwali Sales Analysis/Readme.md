# Diwali Sales Analysis

This project involves analyzing **Diwali sales data** using Python to uncover valuable customer insights, optimize marketing strategies, and identify top-performing products and customer segments.

---

## Objectives
- Import and clean raw Diwali sales data using **Pandas**  
- Explore **customer demographics** and **purchase behavior**  
- Use visualization libraries (**Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**) to reveal sales patterns and business insights  
- Identify profitable **customer segments** and **product categories**

---

## Methodology

### Data Import
- Dataset `Diwali Sales Data.csv` imported using `pd.read_csv()`

### Data Cleaning
- Dropped unnecessary columns (`Unnamed`, `status`)  
- Handled missing values using `dropna()` and `fillna()`

### Data Transformation
- Created new column:  
  `Total Amount = Quantity × Amount`  
- Adjusted data types using `astype()`

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Gender-wise and age-wise spending patterns  
- State-wise revenue distribution  
- Most profitable product categories
